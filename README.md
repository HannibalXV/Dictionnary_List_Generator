# Dictionnary_List_Generator
This code generates various password combinations based on user inputs. It combines different elements such as names, phone numbers, years, and predefined patterns to create a list of possible passwords.

# Necessary Packages:
No additional packages are required for this code.

# Usage:
To use this code, follow these steps:

Copy the code into a Python environment or editor.

Run the code.

The code will prompt you to enter several inputs, such as name, prenom (first name), year, phone, graduation year, club, and pet.

Provide the required inputs when prompted by entering the desired values.

After entering all the inputs, the code will generate various password combinations using the provided inputs.

The generated password combinations will be stored in variables named res1, res2, res3, and so on, depending on the specific combinations generated.
